Joined by Suraj Ravindran, Founder and CEO of Index Fund Sahi Hai, we explore the power of data-driven investing, the underperformance of active mutual funds as highlighted in the SPIVA India Scorecard (https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-india-scorecard-year-end-2024.pdf), and the low costs and diversification benefits of index funds. Suraj also discusses Nobel Prize-winning research behind passive investing and why awareness about index funds remains low in India.\n\n For more insights, check out the Nifty Passive Insights Quarterly Update (https://www.niftyindices.com/Nifty_Passive_Insights/Nifty%20Passive%20Insights%20Quarterly%20update%20-%20January%20to%20March%202024.pdf). \n\nTune in to learn why index funds could be a game-changer for your investments!\n\n#indexfunds, #passiveinvesting, #mutualfunds, #investing, #financialfreedom, #indexfundsahiha, #datadriven, #nifty50, #spivareport, #personalfinance #jioblackrock #adityabirlasunlifeamc #hdfcmutualfund #nippon_india_mutual_fund #sbimutualfund",
